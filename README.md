### React skills used in this app

- useState() and useEffect() hooks were used maintain state between player's moves, to decide the winner, to keep track of the score etc.
- Refactored the code into 3 separate components which gave opportunity learn about how to move data between components using props and state - not only for variables but also functions
- Parent and child components data sharing was a good challenge. Learnt the importance of callback function, especially when to call a function with paranthesis and without.
